# Steam Scraper Project

Created by Brandon Kobayashi

## Before you run the steam scraper

Make sure to download selenium as the scraper uses selenium for collecting data.\
To make sure you do not run into errors, download selenium 4.17.2

```sh
pip install selenium==4.17.2
```

# How to run the steam scraper application
- First, open the main.py file and set a directory you want to store your data that will be collected.
- Secondly, set the other parameters (as shown in the comments of the py file)
- Finally, run the code via the terminal and it should collect data and clean the data.

```sh
python main.py
```

(**Note**: The files should be put in the same directory)

## [NOTICE]
- This steam scraper has only been tested on windows.
- The steam scraper still needs some improvements for the purpose of this project.
