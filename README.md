# Steam Scraper Project
Created by Brandon Kobayashi

# How to run the steam scraper application
First, open the main.py file and set a directory you want to store your data that will be collected.
Secondly, set the other parameters (as shown in the comments of the py file)
Finally, run the code and it should collect data and clean the data

## [NOTICE]
The steam scraper still needs some improvements for the purpose of this project.
